# second post!
In this post we will talk about how to be focused on things we want to do rather than focusing on things that are entartaining but not rewarding. What are the subtles aspects that make we regret doing some things over the others ? 
One thing is related to other people reactions to the activity you're doing. So if you go to gym and people compliment you, this will reinforce you to go to gym. but the negative is also true, if people stop complimenting you might be less motivated to go.
Second thing is about phisiology, in specific stress relief. If you're under stress your unconcious you reward you for reducing this stress levels. With this in mind you will automatically distracted yourself with useless things. This is a big trap because in the end you have a momentary feeling that you're reducing your stress but actually you are just postponing it, and it compounds.
