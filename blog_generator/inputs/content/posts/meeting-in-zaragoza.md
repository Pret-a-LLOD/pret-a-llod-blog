A few weeks ago, the Prêt-à-LLOD project celebrated its second face to
face meeting in [Zaragoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaragoza),
hosted by the [Aragon Institute for Engineering
Research](https://i3a.unizar.es/en). It was two and a half days of
intensive and very productive meeting, but with room also for some table
football and "tapas crawl" ;-)
