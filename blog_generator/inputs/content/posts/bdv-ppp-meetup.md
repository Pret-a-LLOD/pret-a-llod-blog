During the BDV PPP meetup in Riga (Latvia) held in June 2019, Víctor
Rodríguez-Doncel from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid presented the
Prêt-à-LLOD project. In particular, he focused on the ethical
considerations to be made when massively managing language resources.
Making language resources ready-to-use unleashes new powers that have to
be tamed for the general good --the eSides community was consulted in
this fruitful session.
