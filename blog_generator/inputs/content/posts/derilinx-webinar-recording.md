# Prêt-à-LLOD: Derilinx Kweery, a solution for improved cross-border citizens engagement.


More and more jurisdictions in Europe and indeed the World are in the process of building  Open Data portals that support transparency and enable access to key information on Public Services. Linkages between these portals, particularly across multiple languages and jurisdictions are for the most part still to be built.

Intuitive data access and multi-lingual access to information often fall short to support citizens/decision-makers that do not master a particular language. This has a direct impact on the ability to follow local regulations and increase workload for public Customer Services Teams.

Derilinx, as a partner in EU Funded project Pret-a-llod, is in the process of finalizing Kweery, a semantic solution for improved cross-border citizens engagement, that enables users to explore in an intuitive way open data content. It is built using advanced multilingual text analytics techniques and Natural Language Process Techniques.

Derilinx gave a demonstration of Kweery in this webinar.
