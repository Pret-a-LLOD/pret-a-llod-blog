On last May, Prêt-à-LLOD supported the 2nd shared task for [Translation
Inference Across Dictionaries](https://tiad2019.unizar.es/) (TIAD 2019),
aimed at exploring methods and techniques for automatically generating
new bilingual (and multilingual) dictionaries from existing ones. The
techniques that the participants showed there are of high interest for
linking lexical data across languages in the LLOD cloud, which is one of
the targets of the Prêt-à-LLOD project. The organisers plan to publish
the proceedings soon, so stay tuned!
