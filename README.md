## How to **add** POSTS to the blog ?

For creating a new blog post you need to create a markdown(.md) file at the folder **blog_generator/inputs/content/posts/** following some guidelines.
We recommend copying an already existing post [(here)](https://github.com/Pret-a-LLOD/pret-a-llod.github.io/tree/master/blog_generator/inputs/content/posts) to avoid mistakes.

1. create a markdown file or copy a post already created [here](https://github.com/Pret-a-LLOD/pret-a-llod.github.io/tree/master/blog_generator/inputs/content/posts)

2. name it {nameofthepost}.md
